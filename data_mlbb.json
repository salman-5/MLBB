His third big item choice should be Wings of the Apocalypse Queen, further increasing cooldown reduction and survivability. This is a key item for Jawhead. The reason for choosing Oracle here lies in the fact that Jawhead will be on the frontlines of all team battles and will therefore take more damage. The fifth choice, Endless Battle, makes up for this set's lack of damage capacity, and the last choice, Immortality, is essential. With it, Jawhead can still deal considerable damage and make game-changing plays, even after falling."

After this, pick up a Windtalker and Berserker's Fury -- Windtalker has great synergy with Hanabi's basic attacks and can help her to quickly clear minion waves and deal heavy AOE damage during team fights, while Berserker's Fury allows Hanabi to deal greater single-target damage. Last of all, choose a Blade of Despair to further enhance your damage output. This equipment set is fairly balanced.

CD Reduction provided by Bloodthirst allows mounted Leomord to cast more spells. Spell Vamp allows him to drain enemies\u2019 HP by using skill 1, making it easier for mounted Leomord to kill. Leomord needs to first cast spells to wear enemies down then kill them with his basic attacks boosted by his passive, thus Blade of Despair makes a great match with his passive. In this combination, Leomord really stands out as real ruthless low-HP targets butcher. In middle game, you are suggested to select among Wings of the Apocalypse Queen, Rose Gold Meteor and Berserker's Fury depending on the situation. Wings of the Apocalypse Queen and Rose Gold Meteor provide good durability while Berserker's Fury plus his passive could deal extremely high damage."
